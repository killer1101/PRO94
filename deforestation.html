     Deforestation is the clearing, destroying, or otherwise removal of trees through deliberate, natural,
     oor accidental means. It can occur in any area densely populated by trees and other plant life,
     but the majority of it is currently happening in the Amazon rainforest.
    <br><br><br> The loss of trees and other vegetation can cause climate change, desertification,
     soil erosion, fewer crops, flooding, increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, 
     and a host of problems for indigenous people.
     Deforestation occurs for a number of reasons, including farming,
     with 80% of deforestation resulting from extensive cattle ranching, 
     and logging for materials and development. It has been happening for 
     thousands of years, arguably since man began converting from hunter/gatherer 
     to agricultural based societies, and required larger, unobstructed tracks of
     land to accommodate cattle, crops, and housing.<br><br><br> It was only after the onset of
     the modern era that it became an epidemic.
     The United States Environmental Protection Agency defines deforestation as the "permanent removal of standing forests." 
    <br>  The removal, however, occurs for a variety of different reasons and has a variety of devastating consequences.
