        Industrialization has always seemed to be the key to wealth and better living but in reality,
        it has been shown that, although it leads to better conditions of living in certain respects,
        it affects environment and ultimately contributes to climate change.
        <br><br> Industrialization notonly involves technological innovations, it also involves economic and social transformation
        of the human society. With industrialization come opportunities as well as challenges. The 
        challenges include coping with higher temperatures, extreme weather conditions, changing human
        life styles and changing philosophies. Due to these challenges, industrialization must take
        into account climate change and its consequences. 
        <br><br> For example, changing human life styles
        and philosophies have major impacts on environment and this has to be considered. This 
        study examines the links between industrialization and climate change and attempts to 
        address some arguments, which always come up when the effects of human activities on climate 
        change is discussed. Greenhouse gas emissions from industry primarily come from burning fossil
            fuels for energy, as well as greenhouse gas  emissions from certain chemical reactions necessary
        to produce goods from raw materials.
